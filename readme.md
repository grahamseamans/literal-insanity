# Insane Idea: Non-Autoregressive LLM Reasoning with Partitioned Context and GRPO Training

## Concept Overview
We propose a novel approach to LLM reasoning by breaking away from the traditional autoregressive token-by-token generation paradigm. Instead of predicting one token at a time, the model takes a fixed-length input (e.g., 6500 tokens) and generates a structured, fixed-length output (e.g., 7000 tokens) in a single forward pass. The input and output are partitioned into distinct regions (e.g., problem, thought, memory query), akin to a structured memory layout, allowing the model to reason iteratively through loops. Each loop updates the context based on the previous output, and Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fine-tunes the model via reinforcement learning to optimize for correctness, format compliance, and efficiency.

The goal? Decouple the thinking length (chain-of-thought steps) from the input length, enabling arbitrarily long reasoning within a constrained context window, potentially slashing compute costs (e.g., 8K vs. 100K tokens).

## Motivation
Traditional autoregressive LLMs suffer from bloated context windows (e.g., 30K-100K tokens) to handle long reasoning chains, leading to quadratic compute costs and memory bottlenecks. They also struggle with structured reasoning—forgetting early steps or drifting off-topic. This approach aims to:
- **Shrink Context:** Fix input at 6500 tokens, output at 7000 tokens—cheap inference (~10-12 GB VRAM with quantization).
- **Scale Thinking:** Loop outputs back into inputs, enabling unbounded reasoning steps within partitions.
- **Structure Reasoning:** Partition context into regions (e.g., thought as working memory, memory query/answer for external grounding).
- **Train with RL:** Use GRPO to fine-tune the model, rewarding correct answers, format adherence, and fewer steps.

This is a radical departure—non-autoregressive generation is a gamble, as LLMs like DeepScaleR-1.5B-Preview are pretrained autoregressively. But if it works, it could redefine efficient reasoning in LLMs.

## Implementation Details
### Input/Output Formats
- **Input (6500 tokens):**
  - `Problem`: [0-1000] – Fixed problem statement (e.g., "Solve: If x + 2 = 5, what’s x?").
  - `<thought>`: [1000-5000] – Working memory, prior step’s reasoning.
  - `<memory_query>`: [5000-5500] – Prior step’s query.
  - `<memory_answer>`: [5500-6500] – Retrieved memory from prior query.
- **Output (7000 tokens):**
  - `<thought>`: [1000-5000] – New reasoning step.
  - `<memory_query>`: [5000-5500] – New query.
  - `<write_to_memory>`: [6500-7500] – Insights to save.
  - `<answer>`: [7500-8000] – Answer attempt.

### Loop Structure
1. **NN Call:** Feed input (6500 tokens) to the model, generate output (7000 tokens) greedily (no beam search).
2. **Post-NN-Call Processing:**
   - Validate output format—penalize if tags exceed partitions.
   - Process `<memory_query>`: Fetch from FAISS-backed memory bank.
   - Save `<write_to_memory>` content to memory.
   - Check `<answer>` against dataset (e.g., GSM8K).
3. **Update Input:** Construct next input using output’s sections plus fetched memory answer.
4. **Repeat:** Loop until answer is correct or max steps hit.

### GRPO Training
- **Rewards:**
  - Correct answer: +1.
  - Format violation: -0.5 per step if tags exceed partitions.
  - Efficiency: -0.1 per step.
- **Training:** Collect rollouts (prompt, output, reward) per episode, batch them (e.g., 16 episodes), and train with GRPO:
  - Group-normalized advantages (GRPO’s twist on PPO).
  - Clipped surrogate loss, KL penalty for stability.
  - Tune: learning rate (1e-5), clip epsilon (0.2), target KL (0.01).

### Memory System
- **FAISS Index:** `IndexFlatL2`, embeddings via `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384D).
- **Initial Content:** Tutorial ("Break into steps, query memory") and current problem.
- **Dynamic Growth:** Add `<write_to_memory>` content each step—scales reasoning via external memory.

## Challenges and Why It’s Insane
- **Non-Autoregressive Leap:** LLMs like DeepScaleR are pretrained autoregressively—generating 7000 tokens in one shot might yield gibberish.
- **Training Stability:** GRPO needs careful tuning—unstable outputs make learning hard.
- **VRAM:** ~10-12 GB with quantization and tweaks (batch size 4, 4-bit); ~20-25 GB full batch (16).
- **Risk:** If it fails (likely), outputs won’t converge—needs a hybrid approach (autoregressive within partitions).

## Why It’s Worth Trying
If this works—even partially—it could slash compute costs (8K vs. 80K token contexts), scale reasoning indefinitely, and pave the way for structured, memory-augmented LLMs. A small experiment (100 problems) can tell us if it’s viable or if we pivot.
